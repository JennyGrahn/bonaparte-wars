## Features Left to Implement

- Initial plans included an interactive timeline, but due to technical issues, it was not implemented.
- An alternative idea was a list of links corresponding to specific years in the timeline to aid navigation.
- In the future, I am also looking to structure the text in a better way.
- "The Napoleonic Wars" is a continuous project and is going to get more text to cover more aspects of this interesting era.

# Testing

- I have tested the website in four different browsers: Safari, Firefox, Swiss Cows, and Chrome. Swiss Cows were not tested on a laptop but on a mobile phone.
- I have confirmed that the page headers, text, images, and text are easy to understand and navigate.
- The form works, and the field specified for the email only accepts an email address.

- Accessibility

I have made sure the choice of color, layout, and font is easy to read and understand. This was a conscious decision when choosing the colors, which were inspired by the French flag.
