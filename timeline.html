                <p id="text">
                    Born on August 15, 1769, in Corsica, which had recently become a French territory, Napoleon came
                    from a modest background. His education took place in the mainland of France, where he displayed a
                    keen interest in military strategy and history.
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    In 1785, at the age of 16, Napoleon entered the French military academy in Paris for a year before
                    graduating, ranking 42nd of 58 students in his class.
                    Upon graduation in 1785, Napoleon joined the French Army as a second lieutenant of artillery,
                    stationed in a regiment in La Fère—an educational stationing for young artillery officers. Fast
                    forward a couple of years in time, the French Revolution was around the corner. The young Napoleon
                    read works from authors like Voltaire and Rousseau; he found the ideas intresting, however, he did
                    not
                    feel the necessity for radical change.
                    <!--Remember to check the facts regarding his relationship to the enlightenment ideas and his education-->
                </p>
                <p id="text">
                    He quickly rose through the ranks, probably thanks to his strategic abilities and the political
                    chaos of the French Revolution. The turning point in Napoleon's early military career came during
                    the Italian Campaign (1796-1797). Leading the French army, he achieved a series of victories against
                    the Austrians and their allies, earning him the nickname "The Little Corporal." His strategic
                    brilliance and political acumen allowed him to negotiate favorable treaties and enhance his
                    reputation both on the battlefield and in the political sphere.

                    By 1799, Napoleon had become a celebrated military general and a key figure in French politics. His
                    success in Italy and, combined with political maneuvering in France, set the stage for the Coup of
                    18 Brumaire, where he seized power and established the Consulate, marking the beginning of his road
                    to becoming the future emperor. And marking the beginning of the Napoleonic era and its wars.

                    the tumultuous era of the French Revolution. The establishment of the Consulate marked a pivotal

                <p id="text">In June of 1800, the Battle of Marengo unfolded as a pivotal moment in Napoleon's military
                    career. Fought in Italy between Napoleon's forces and the Austrians, the engagement initially posed
                    challenges for the French.

                <p id="text">
                    Facing initial setbacks, Napoleon maneuvered his troops, orchestrating a remarkable turnaround that
                    ultimately secured a victory at Marengo. The Battle of Marengo showcased his ability to outmaneuver
                    and outthink his opponents, earning him a reputation as a formidable military strategist.

                <p id="text">
                    This victory solidified Napoleon's grip on power, further strengthening his position as the First
                    Consul of France. The French people, buoyed by the success at Marengo, rallied around Napoleon,
                    viewing him as a symbol of national strength

                    Abroad, Europe's reactions varied during. Austria sought diplomatic solutions after the Battle of
                    Marengo.
                    Britain, a longstanding enemy, maintained naval dominance, contributing to a protracted conflict.
                    Russia initially engaged diplomatically but later became a key player in anti-Napoleonic coalitions,
                    especially after the invasion of 1812, but more on that later. Initially Prussia aligned with
                    France, but later reevaluating policies after significant defeats the years that followed.

                        Treaty of Amiens in May 1802, which represented a temporary halt in hostilities. The treaty
                        brought about a brief interlude of peace, concluding the previous years of war. However,
                        tensions were underneath the surface between the two countries.

                        intentions.

                        across the globe. Ideological differences and distrust fueled the war, when Britain declared

                        Allies. This manoeuvre, known as the "double envelopment" or the "manoeuvre of the central
                        position," shattered the Allied lines and secured victory for the French.

                        found the city deserted and set on fire by the retreating Russians.

                        The occupation of Moscow did not lead to a decisive victory, and with the onset of the harsh
                        Russian winter, coupled with dwindling supplies and the relentless harassment by Russian forces,
                        the situation for the Grande Armée became miserable. With the harsh Russian winter approaching,
                        Napoleon decided to retreat in October 1812.

                    <p id="text">
                        The severe winter conditions, lack of provisions, and constant attacks from Russian forces led
                        to catastrophic losses for the army. By the time the remnants of the army crossed the Berezina
                        River in late November, it had been reduced to a mere fraction of its initial strength.
                        The Russian campaign proved disastrous for Napoleon, as it resulted in the near-total collapse
                        of the Grande Armée. The defeat damaged Napoleon's military reputation and marked a turning
                        point in the Napoleonic Wars.

                        The Battle of Leipzig, recognized as the Battle of Nations, waged in March 1813. The
                        Battle of Leipzig involved an alliance of Russian, Prussian, Austrian, and Swedish forces
                        confronting Napoleon's Grande Armée. The conflict unfolded over several days, with intense
                        fighting across diverse terrain.

                    <p id="text">
                        In April 1814, confronted by external opposition and internal challenges, Napoleon
                        Bonaparte made the momentous decision to abdicate the throne. This move led to the restoration
                        of the Bourbon monarchy in France, effectively concluding the era of Napoleonic dominance, at
                        least for the moment being.
                    </p>
                    <p id="text">
                        Napoleon's abdication occurred amidst growing resistance from European coalitions and
                        war-weariness among the French people. The abdication set the stage for the Bourbon Restoration,
                        with Louis XVIII ascending to the throne.
                    </p>
                    <p id="text">
                        Following his abdication, Napoleon experienced exile on the island of Elba, signaling the end of
                        his rule over France. While the Napoleonic era came to a temporary halt, subsequent events
                        unfolded that would bring about Napoleon's return during the Hundred Days in 1815.

                        present-day Belgium, marked the culmination of the Hundred Days and the end of Napoleon
                        Bonaparte's rule.

                        The battle unfolded between the French forces under Napoleon and the coalition armies led by the
                        Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, and the Prussian forces commanded by Gebhard Leberecht von
                        Blücher.

                    <p id="text">
                        The fighting was intense, with both sides sustaining heavy casualties. Napoleon sought to break
                        Wellington's lines and secure a decisive victory, but the steadfastness of the Anglo-Allied
                        forces, coupled with the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, shifted the wheel of
                        fortune.

                    <p id="text">
                        The turning point came in the afternoon when Blücher's Prussian forces regrouped and attacked
                        the French right flank. The arrival of the Prussians forced Napoleon to divert his attention,
                        creating a vulnerable point in the French lines that Wellington used to his advantage.

                        The Battle of Waterloo concluded with the French army's retreat, marking a definitive victory
                        for the coalition forces. The aftermath of the battle saw Napoleon abdicating for the second
                        time in July 1815. It led to Napoleon's final exile to the remote island of Saint Helena, where
                        he spent the remainder of his life.
